HELLO WORLD

data:
an attempt at creating a vector embedding similar to the one used for lore except this one can help you scripting.

at the moment it can help with boiler plate code, but can not create code that runs by itself.

this embeds into a chatgpt assistant, you can review my other mod for help with that.

currently it is trained a filtered version of: 
1. openMW lua docs: https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/lua-scripting/index.html
2. openMW code written after Jan 1st 2024 (checking for date and whether openmw is in the lua file): https://github.com/MWSE/morrowind-nexus-lua-dump
3. final size of a json is less than 1mb.
