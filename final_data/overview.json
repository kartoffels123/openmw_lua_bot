Includes starting stats and links to assets, but doesn\u2019t have a location. Game objects are instances of records. Some records (e.g. a unique NPC) have a single instance, some (e.g. a specific potion) may correspond to multiple objects. Note Don\u2019t be confused with MWSE terminology. In MWSE game objects are \u201creferences\u201d and records are \u201cobjects\u201d. An area of the game world. A position in the world is a link to a cell and X, Y, Z coordinates in the cell. At a specific moment in time each cell can be active or inactive. Inactive cells don\u2019t perform physics updates. Lua scripts that are not attached to any game object and are always active. Global scripts can not be started or stopped during a game session. Lists of global scripts are defined byomwscriptsfiles, which should beregisteredinopenmw.cfg. Lua scripts that are ran regardless of a game being loaded. They can be used to add features to the main menu and manage save files. Lua scripts that are attached to some game object. A local script is active only if the object it is attached to is in an active cell. There are no limitations to the number of local scripts on one object. Local scripts can be attached to (or detached from) any object at any moment by a global script. In some cases inactive local scripts still can run code (for example during saving and loading), but while inactive they can not see nearby objects. Note Currently scripts on objects in a container or an inventory are considered inactive. Probably later this behaviour will be changed. A specific kind of local scripts;player scriptis a local script that is attached to a player. It can do everything that a normal local script can do, plus some player-specific functionality (e.g. control UI and camera). This scripting API was developed to be conceptually compatible withmultiplayer. In multiplayer the server is lightweight and delegates most of the work to clients. Each client processes some part of the game world. Global scripts are server-side and local scripts are client-side. Because of this, there are several rules for the Lua scripting API: A local script can see only some area of the game world (cells that are active on a specific client). Any data from inactive cells can\u2019t be used, as they are not synchronized and could be already changed on another client. A local script can only modify the object it is attached to. Other objects can theoretically be processed by another client. To prevent synchronization problems the access to them is read-only. Global scripts can access and modify the whole game world including unloaded areas, but the global scripts API is different from the local scripts API and in some aspects limited, because it is not always possible to have all game assets in memory at the same time. Though the scripting system doesn\u2019t actually work with multiplayer yet, the API assumes that there can be several players. That\u2019s why any command related to UI, camera, and everything else that is player-specific can be used only by player scripts."

Event handlers have a single argumenteventData(must beserializable) There are a few methods for sending events: core.sendGlobalEventto send events to global scripts GameObject:sendEventto send events to local scripts attached to a game object types.Player.sendMenuEventto send events to menu scripts of the given player Events are the main way of interacting between local and global scripts.\nThey are not recommended for interactions between two global scripts, because in this case interfaces are more convenient.
